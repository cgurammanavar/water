Water Monitoring and Leakage Control System

Iam using NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E) Module as MCU before connectiong NodeMUC instal the CH3406 driver
then go through the code I have uploaded once follow it and you'll see i have used Blynk as a Iot platform to 
Monitor the data or process the data beacause it has its own web dashboad, Andriod and Ios support.

Create your account in the Blynk Platform (you can use others too) the create the virtual pins accordingly
assign them accordingly then connect the flow sensor and solenoid value to the NodeMCU you may need a 5v supply
for flow sensor to work then make the connections assgin the pins on the board connect the flow sensor.

Create widgets with adding the device in the Blynk Platform as you want to monitor the data then assing the 
pins then process the data you can monitor the real time data add notifications fot specific tasks like for
lekage.Enter your wifi cred in the code ssid and pwd it will connect it to internet.
